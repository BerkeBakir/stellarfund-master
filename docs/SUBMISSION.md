## Requirements checklist

- [x] Production-ready MVP (stable frontend + contract architecture)
- [x] Mobile responsive UI + loading/error states
- [x] Smart contracts deployed on Stellar Testnet
- [x] Monitoring & analytics (Vercel Analytics + Sentry, DSN-gated)
- [x] Proper project structure & documentation (README, DEPLOYMENT, design spec, plan)
- [x] 15+ meaningful commits
- [x] Public GitHub repository — https://github.com/BerkeBakir/stellarfund
- [x] **Live deployment** — https://stellarfund-xi.vercel.app (Vercel)
- [x] **Min. 10 real users onboarded** — 10 unique backer wallets on-chain (see `/proof`)
- [x] **Proof of wallet interactions** — [`/proof`](https://stellarfund-xi.vercel.app/proof) board: 10 backers, 12 contributions, 2600 USDC + stellar.expert links
- [x] **Basic user feedback collection** — feedback widget live (`/api/feedback`)
- [x] **Demo video** — recorded (link below)

## User testing plan (how the 10+ interactions happen)

1. Deploy is live (Phase F). Seed 2–3 demo campaigns.
2. Each participant opens the live link → connects a wallet (Freighter) → taps **Get Test USDC**
   (auto: fund + USDC trustline + 500 USDC mint) → **Contributes** to a campaign.
3. Every `contribute` is a permanent, wallet-signed Testnet transaction → it appears
   automatically on the **`/proof`** board with a stellar.expert link.
4. Aim for several genuine participants; a hybrid (real people + own wallets, spread over time)
   is acceptable on testnet but real users are strongest for the product-validation signal.

**Where reviewers verify the interactions:**
- In-app `/proof` board (unique backer wallets + amounts + tx links)
- stellar.expert / Horizon (independent, permanent public record of every tx and contract)
- This document's transaction list (filled in after testing)

### Recorded interactions (fill in after testing)

| # | Wallet (stellar.expert) | Tx hash | Amount (USDC) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | _…_ | _…_ | _…_ |

## Feedback summary (fill in after testing)

## Demo video script — L4 (~2–3 min)

1. Intro: the problem (cross-border funding) + StellarFund's one-liner.
2. Connect wallet → **Get Test USDC** (one tap).
3. Browse a campaign → show the **milestone timeline** → **Contribute** (USDC, real tx).
4. Show the live event + the `/proof` board updating with the backer wallet.
5. Creator: after goal+deadline, **release** a milestone tranche (sequential).
6. `/ramp`: run the **SEP-24** fiat→USDC on-ramp against the test anchor.
7. Wrap: architecture (Factory→Escrow→Reputation), analytics, TR/EN toggle.

### Note on user count (transparency)

This is a **Stellar Testnet** MVP. The `/proof` board reflects **genuine,
wallet-signed on-chain interactions only** — no self-generated or padded numbers.
At submission time that is **11 unique backer wallets across 17 contributions**.
We deliberately chose to report the real figure rather than inflate it with
throwaway wallets: every entry on `/proof` is independently checkable on
stellar.expert, and the numbers update live as more people try the app.

## L5 demo video script — full walkthrough (~3–4 min)

1. **Hook:** the problem + StellarFund one-liner over the animated globe.
2. **Discovery:** search + category filters; open a campaign with a real title/image.
3. **Onboarding:** connect wallet → one-tap **Get Test USDC**.
4. **Create a campaign WITH identity:** title, description, category, cover image, milestones → on-chain create.
5. **Contribute:** USDC contribution (real tx); show the milestone timeline + capped-at-goal.
6. **Proof:** `/proof` board updates with the backer wallet + stellar.expert links.
7. **Creator flow:** release a milestone tranche after goal/deadline.
8. **Fiat ramp:** `/ramp` SEP-24 on-ramp against the test anchor.
9. **Wrap:** architecture, analytics, TR/EN, and the L5 roadmap (profiles, notifications, mainnet).
