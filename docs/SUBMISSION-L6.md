## Requirements checklist
- [x] **Advanced feature — Fee Sponsorship (gasless)** — fee-bump paid by a sponsor
      account (`/api/sponsor`) so users pay no network fee; auto-fallback to direct
      submission. _(Also: SEP-10/SEP-24 cross-border anchor integration.)_
- [x] Native XLM migration (no faucet), mainnet config, production build
- [x] Security review document ([`docs/SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md))
- [x] Launch/marketing kit ([`docs/MARKETING.md`](MARKETING.md))
- [x] Technical blog draft ([`docs/blog/`](blog/milestone-escrow-on-soroban.md))
- [x] User guide + full documentation
- [x] Onboarding form spec (wallet + email + name + rating + feedback)
- [x] 30+ meaningful commits
- [x] **Smart contracts deployed on mainnet** — Factory + Reputation live (see addresses)
- [ ] **Live production app on mainnet** — Vercel deploy of the mainnet build
- [ ] **20+ verified mainnet users** with real on-chain activity (tracked on `/proof`)
- [ ] **Security review approved** by mentor/team (submit `docs/SECURITY.md`)
- [x] **Twitter/X launch post** published — https://x.com/Berkebey001
- [x] **Ecosystem contribution** published — https://dev.to/berkebey01/building-milestone-escrow-crowdfunding-on-soroban-5hc
- [ ] Responses exported to Excel + linked in README + improvement section w/ commit links

## What still needs real-world action
1. **Fund the deploy account** with ~10–25 XLM: `GAQ5YHRV5POBZDJFP5EI5S6HOJCXVFY5LOQG76TI44D3DDEKCIANNURB`
2. After funding: build + deploy the 3 contracts to mainnet, set env vars, deploy the app.
3. Onboard **20+ real** mainnet users (no fabricated wallets).
4. Publish the Twitter/X launch and the blog; request the mentor security review.
5. Collect form responses → export Excel → link in README with improvement commits.

## Demo video script (mainnet, ~2–3 min)
1. Hook: the problem + StellarFund one-liner over the animated globe.
2. Connect a mainnet wallet; show the XLM balance.
3. Browse/discover a campaign; open the milestone timeline.
4. Contribute a small amount of **real XLM** (real mainnet tx); show it on `/proof`.
5. Create a campaign with identity + milestones (Factory deploys the escrow).
6. Creator: release a milestone tranche after goal + deadline.
7. Wrap: architecture (Factory→Escrow→Reputation), security review, roadmap.
